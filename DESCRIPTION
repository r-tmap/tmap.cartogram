Description: Provides new layer functions to 'tmap' for creating various types of cartograms. A cartogram is a type of thematic map in which geographic areas are resized or distorted based on a quantitative variable, such as population. The goal is to make the area sizes proportional to the selected variable while preserving geographic positions as much as possible.
